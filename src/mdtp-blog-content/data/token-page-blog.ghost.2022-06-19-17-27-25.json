We added a bunch of stuff we wanted from the old one\n- cheaper minting and making it pausable, a new ERC spceification. We also\nremoved a bunch of functions we never used.\n\n\nMigration from v1 to v2\nA key challenge is migrating the old owners to the new contract. It works like\nthis:\nin the original contract lets say we have these tokens minted already:\n\n#1 -> 0x123\n#711 -> 0x456\n#712 -> 0x456\n#811 -> 0x456\n#812 -> 0x456\n#9011 -> 0x789\n#9012 -> 0x789\n\nso we have 7 tokens minted by three people. in the original contract this\naffects storage in a few places but the main one is in an array called _owners \nwhere it literally has a map from tokenId -> owner as shown above.\n\nPopulating this array directly into the new contract would not only be expensive\nbut it would also break a number of ERC721 standards, most notably it would not\nautomatically send out the Transfer event that many dapps rely on to monitor\ntokens.\n\nAll-in-all transposing the ownership from the old contract to the new would cost\nway over $50k at current eth prices. This is too much of a cost for us to bear\nas a young project.\n\nThe next ideal situation would be to point to the old contract for old tokens\nand to the new contract for new owners. However, we don't have a way to stop\npeople from minting in the old contract so we would have to know exactly which\ntokens are part of the old batch and tell the new contract to point to the old\nones for those.\n\nThe alternative we've designed is that the new looks to the old contract for a\nhardcoded list of tokens that we will specify. To do this when we initialise the\ncontract we will set the old contract as the owner of the tokenIds that have\nalready been minted.\n\nThis will cost us ~10k.\n\nUnfortunately we haven't found a cheaper way of doing this so it's a cost we\nwill have to bear.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-01-21 22:21:06","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-03-31 17:50:09","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"61f98cb7fe87f90001896c92","uuid":"607b4f7b-2ecd-4bae-8664-98e5f4dac720","title":"(2022) Complete guide to building & engaging your NFT community","slug":"build-and-engage-nft-community","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxFsT54ATZA\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"113\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxFsT54ATZA?feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer;

(Yet)\n\nAnd here’s your tissue: focus on building a community first, art second.\n\nDesigning and minting your NFT is exciting. But to make it successful with high\nengagement and a positive ROI, a strong community will be the key to selling\nyour work and growing your project.\n\nSo whether you’re an NFT buyer or aspiring seller, it’s high time you learn what\nit takes to grow one successfully. At Million Dollar Token Page\n[https://milliondollartokenpage.com/], we’re going to cover everything you need\nto know about NFT communities and showcase leading examples on how to drive\ngrowth.\n\nWhy are communities so essential for an NFT’s success?\nThink about what a startup needs to lift off: Investors, an action team, and a\ncommunity to consume the offering.\n\nFor a blockchain startup (NFT creators), the community does all three. Except,\ninterested parties not only support the project (e.g., on social media or with\nmoney), they often have a stake in the project themselves and build on the NFT \n(develop applications around it).\n\nA crypto community essentially gives your NFT a purpose. The symbiotic\nrelationship can then snowball into a successful ecosystem around your NFT, with\nthe community being the lifeline.\n\nExample of community in action: CryptoKitties\nCryptoKitty [https://www.cryptokitties.co/] started as an NFT art collectible of\nvirtual cats. But since this token is extensible, the owners and community\nmembers were able to actively engage in developing add-on applications around \nthe NFT concept.\n\nAnd born was the KittyVerse: a digital world of gamified applications for\nCyptoKitty NFTs, where people can use their Kitties to duel, have their genes\nexplained, breed with other Kitties, and be used as collateral for fungible\nERC-20 tokens.\n\nAll these different abilities in the KittyVerse demonstrate how an engaged\ncommunity can give life to an NFT through some creative thought and code.\n\nWhat you need for an NFT project that stands out\nThe most successful NFT projects have some things in common – below are some\nbest practices and pro tips you can implement for your own NFT project.\n\n 1. A collaborative team with different skillsets (graphic design, programming,\n    community outreach and marketing). Instead of spreading yourself too thin\n    and compromising quality, find a group of like-minded and skilled NFT\n    enthusiasts to tackle different areas of your project.\n 2. Especially someone to truly engage the community. Developers & designers\n    won’t have time to answer questions and fulfill public roles full-time. NFTs\n    are a new space with a lot of naivety, and having someone who knows what\n    they’re talking about can be magnetic for new members who need some\n    reassurance and certainty.\n 3. High-quality & original art – whether you hire someone or do it yourself,\n    devote a lot of time and passion to your art. With creative design and\n    unique storytelling, you’ll knock meme competitors out of the park (although\n    memes can still be important for storytelling).\n\nJunkyard Dogs [https://junkyarddogs.io/] (JYD), for example, were one of the\nfirst to coin NFT animations that received great social feedback for their\nnovelty and appeal.\n\nA compelling story. It’s easier to build an interested community and fanbase\naround your NFT when you give it lore. Speak on its origin, what it stands for,\nand your overarching vision.

For\n   instance, if you want more discord members, you could offer investors early\n   ownership access to an NFT, which allows them to avoid competitive drops.\n\nHow to influence consideration for your NFT\nBefore we start this section, it’s important to remember that the points from\nthe last section can strongly influence people’s consideration for your NFT as\nwell. All of them increase your credibility and instill trust in the consumer,\nincreasing the chances that they pick you.\n\nHere’s a quick recap of the points we already covered:\n\n * NFT boards like Million Dollar Token Page\n * Content marketing (blog posts, videos, podcasts, and social media posts)\n * Podcasts\n * Forums & communities\n * Influencer collaborations\n * Incentivized referrals\n\nIn addition to those tricks, here are some fantastic strategies that you can use\nto influence consideration for your NFT.\n\n * Search engine optimization (SEO) – 75.7% of clicks go to the first four\n   organic results\n   [https://firstpagesage.com/seo-blog/google-click-through-rates-ctrs-by-ranking-position-in-2022/] \n   on the search engine results page. Strong NFT brand visibility and activity\n   (e.g. content marketing) on search engines is a winning method for attracting \n   lots of web surfers to learn more and consider your NFT.\n * Since SEO is a data-driven domain that needs expertise, it can be smart to\n   hire professional SEO content marketing services [https://www.embarque.io/] \n   who do the heavy lifting for you.\n * An attractive website with trust elements – As lucrative NFTs can be, the\n   space is also notorious for scams and hacks. It’s a good idea to set the\n   right impression with a professional website coupled with social proof\n   elements that foster trust to remove any doubts and uncertainties from the\n   get-go.\n * This could be like the size of your discord community, showing off dapps\n   built around your NFT concept, announcing partnerships with credible\n   influencers or companies, and so on.\n * FAQs – when prospects are considering your NFT, they’ll likely have questions\n   they need answered. A dedicated FAQ section or page helps them make an\n   informed decision. Without one, you may find prospects turned off from the\n   ambiguity and opt for a competitor who has answers.\n * Review sites – alongside your own site’s standing, it’s also important to\n   consider what others are saying about you. There’s an obvious bias on a\n   creator’s personal site and users know this – so they’ll also read opinions\n   on third-party platforms.\n * Mint your NFT on-chain – doing so invites fellow community members to access\n   its data and create dapps around your NFT concept. That, in turn, will\n   attract even more people and snowball a loyal community.\n\nConversion\nThe prospect is getting warmer and warmer in purchasing your NFT at this point.\nNow you’ll need to determine the best place to sell your NFTs. Depending on what\nit is exactly, your NFT marketplace will vary.\n\nHere are your options for NFT marketplaces to add your listing to:\n\n * OpenSea [https://opensea.io/?ref=hackernoon.com]- world’s largest NFT trading\n   platform. Popular categories include art, music, domain names, and virtual\n   worlds.\n * Crypto.com [https://crypto.com/nft/marketplace]- a platform is best suited\n   for selling art, sports collectibles, and celebrity items.\n * Myth Market [https://myth.market/]- a great place to find unique trading\n   cards.\n * SuperRare [https://superrare.co/?ref=hackernoon.com]- focuses specifically on\n   digital art. Ether is used for transactions, and you can connect your\n   Ethereum wallet to your account. .\n * Rarible [https://rarible.com/?ref=hackernoon.com]- art, photography, music,\n   games, and metaverses. You can interact with the community through native\n   discussion boards and connect various crypto wallets.\n * NFT Hunters [http://nfthunters.com/]- each day, NFT Hunters selects the next\n   best NFT and de-fi projects and delivers them directly to subscribers'\n   inboxes. You can apply to be featured in their emails by sending an email to\n   team@defihunters.com.\n * MakersPlace [https://makersplace.com/?ref=hackernoon.com]- you can sell\n   digital art creations through MakersPlace's storefront for free. Each time\n   you make a sale, MakersPlace will charge you 15% plus 2.9% for credit card\n   sales. Payments can be made with credit cards or cryptocurrencies.\n * Solanart [https://solanart.io/] - the NFTs sold on Solanart include art,\n   games, and metaverses. To interact with the marketplace, you’ll need a Solana\n   wallet like Phantom or Sollet. They also take a 3% fee on marketplace\n   transactions.\n\nNurture your NFT community\nIf you want a truly successful NFT that performs long-term, you can’t forget\nabout buyers post-transaction (or even before they make the purchase). You need\nto proactively develop your community through consistent engagement and value\npropositions for user retention.\n\nHere are some ways:\n\n * Member-only community – An exclusive hub for enthusiasts of your NFT concept\n   including dapp developers, investors, and participating community members.\n   You can grow this population on platforms like Twitter or Discord, where you\n   could offer exclusive perks and offers to keep them happy.\n * Online events and offline meetups – If you’ve built dapps around your NFT\n   concept, like virtual gaming worlds and activities, you can get creative and\n   hold tournaments for championship prizes. Or, you can hold live Q&A sessions,\n   show unique blockchain technology demonstrations, brainstorm dapps, and share\n   updates or news to keeps users engaged. Organize IRL meetups allow community\n   members to get to know each other and socialize outside the confines of the\n   virtual space. You can then incentivize participation through POAPs (more on\n   these shortly).\n * Email marketing campaigns – Emails can also be a nice intimate way to keep in\n   touch with leads and community members. You can provide them with updates on\n   your projects, share news in the NFT space, and provide exclusive offers as\n   you may on discord channels. That said, you need to be a little careful with\n   this, as some of your privacy-minded members might not like to use this\n   medium to interact!\n\nDrive awareness, consideration, & engagement with POAPs\nProof of attendance protocols (POAPs) is a type of NFT that acts as a “badge” or\n“symbol” for the collector, commemorating their involvement in a special event.\nYou can repurpose them for many areas of the funnel like:\n\n * For awareness and consideration, you could do a POAP giveaway to, say, the\n   first 100 people to join your community or event, which would act as an\n   “early bird” status symbol for the rest of your community’s life. This can\n   spread the word about events you’re hosting and encourage others to get in on\n   your incentives for POAP holders.\n * For community engagement, you might use a POAP like a “merit badge” to award\n   community members for doing something (like building a dapp around your NFT\n   or being active in community channels). These collectors can be subject to\n   special offers and privileges for their contributions, also being an\n   inspiration for other community members.\n\nIt’s best to create your POAP a few days before an event due to the 24-hour\napproval process. You can make a 500x500px POAP design on free sites like Canva\n[https://www.canva.com/], use photoshop, or hire professional designers on \nFiverr\n[https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=design%20POAP&modified_query=design%20pop&source=search_did_you_mean&should_suggest=false&search-autocomplete-original-term=design%20POAP] \nto do it for you.\n\nAfter you’re done, you’re ready to launch it by filling out some preliminary\ninfo first [https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new].\n\nSetting up your marketing drop for success\n 1. Add your drop to an NFT calendar [https://nftcal.xyz/]. These are great\n    platforms to promote your release with all the finer details like an NFT\n    description, data and time of the drop, the marketplace of your drop, and an\n    official link to your release.\n\n 1. Flesh out an engaging teaser. People don’t care about your NFT’s life story.\n    But they might after you entice them with a shorter engaging teaser\n    summarizing the cool parts about your origin and message. If you need help\n    communicating your message, you could hire a qualified copywriter who can\n    create a great story around your NFT.\n 2. Start preparing your audience on social media at least two weeks before your\n    NFT drop. Showcase your drop on popular platforms like Twitter, Instagram,\n    and Discord and storytell your inspirations, creative process, and failures\n    to engage your followers.\n 3. Try landing featured drops on the marketplace. You can attract more\n    attention and build credibility as a blockchain startup by getting your NFT\n    featured. This type of promotion is organized directly with marketplaces,\n    which have dedicated web pages for featured drops and their details.\n 4. Order a PR article about your NFT drop. Partnering with media sites is\n    another great way to build credibility for your new project and get a lot of\n    eyes in front of it fast.\n\nStart showing off your NFT on the Million Dollar Token Page\nHooray! You made it to the end. You should have a solid idea of how to approach\nyour NFT marketing strategy by now. It’s time to start building a successful NFT\nloved by the people.\n\nA great way to easily attract lots of eyes and clicks to your NFT project is by \nsecuring a sizeable pixel block on the Million Dollar Token Page. You could\nresell your digital space for a profit later on or keep it as your place in\ncrypto history as the site grows more popular.\n\nYou can claim your digital piece of NFT real estate here\n[https://milliondollartokenpage.com/].","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1638913974023-cef988e81629?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wxfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fG5mdHxlbnwwfHx8fDE2NDQzOTIyMTI&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"61f98c95fe87f90001896c8f","created_at":"2022-02-09 07:30:13","created_by":"61f98c95fe87f90001896c8f","updated_at":"2022-04-06 15:59:24","updated_by":"61eb3267fe87f90001896c84","published_at":"2022-02-09 07:37:03","published_by":"61f98c95fe87f90001896c8f","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"62080487fe87f90001896d1b","uuid":"5bf47f95-d9c2-4db9-9d5a-a9d3bd6ba15f","title":"Thinking about gas when writing NFT contracts ⛽️","slug":"thinking-about-gas-when-writing-nft-contracts","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"why is this important\"]],[[0,[],0,\"find some examples of how much gas cost - bayc, apes\"]],[[0,[],0,\"find information about what constitutes how gas is calculated\"]],[[0,[],0,\"tools for testing gas\"]],[[0,[],0,\"example with whitelist\"]],[[0,[],0,\"example with off chain validation\"]],[[0,[],0,\"cover erc721A and why it works\"]],[[0,[],0,\"multiple minting\"]]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}","html":"<ul><li>why is this important</li><li>find some examples of how much gas cost - bayc, apes</li><li>find information about what constitutes how gas is calculated</li><li>tools for testing gas</li><li>example with whitelist</li><li>example with off chain validation</li><li>cover erc721A and why it works</li><li>multiple minting</li></ul>","comment_id":"62080487fe87f90001896d1b","plaintext":" * why is this important\n * find some examples of how much gas cost - bayc, apes\n * find information about what constitutes how gas is calculated\n * tools for testing gas\n * example with whitelist\n * example with off chain validation\n * cover erc721A and why it works\n * multiple minting","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-02-12 19:03:35","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-02-12 19:10:16","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"620804c0fe87f90001896d21","uuid":"179bb1c2-8a62-4e60-8a61-f68219704545","title":"On-chain vs off-chain content when writing web3 apps ⛓","slug":"on-chain-vs-off-chain-content-when-writing-web3-apps","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"mdtp started with on-chain only/ it's the pure and, in our view, perfect way to have the data stored. but it costs a fuckload. so we allowed people to do things off-chain.\"]],[[0,[],0,\"How do we prove that someone is who they say they are\"]],[[0,[],0,\"How can we prove later that someone did indeed certify this onchain content\"]],[[0,[],0,\"How do we consolidate on-chain and off-chain content\"]],[[0,[],0,\"How does this affect your app?

Although the\nDeFi ecosystem has a wide range of uses, these are two of the most notable.\n\nNon-fungible tokens are a fantastic fit for real-world assets, gaming, health\ncare, and more because of their exclusivity and rarity. Due to this, we can\nanticipate more experimental use cases of NFTs as they evolve.\n\nAt the Million Dollar Token Page [https://milliondollartokenpage.com/], we’re\ngoing to explore some interesting NFT use cases and experimental ideas that are\ncurrently making waves.\n\nBut first, let's quickly introduce you to NFTs.\n\n\nWhat are NFTs, and how are they used?\nNon-fungible tokens, often known as NFTs, are unique digital assets that you\ncan't swap with something else. They guarantee you the ownership of a digital\nasset when you buy one.\n\nNFT transaction details are protected by a blockchain network. They’ve paved the\nway for businesses and digital content providers alike to take advantage of new\nopportunities. As a result, the digital asset has emerged as a valuable medium\nfor artists to share their work and earn money from it.\n\nMillion Dollar Token Page, a board to show, advertise and market NFT projects\n[https://blog.milliondollartokenpage.com/market-promote-advertise-your-nft/],\nand other popular sites like it allow NFT creators to display their art by\npurchasing pixel blocks of screen\n[https://blog.milliondollartokenpage.com/nft-gallery/] real estate. This is a\ngreat way to get the word out about your NFT project while also generating\nadditional traffic.\n\nNFTs can be used in a variety of fields due to their favourable characteristics\nand high-quality design. Because of this, the whole range of NFT applications\nvaries greatly among various industries. As a follow-up, we'll take a look at\nsome of the intriguing NFT use cases, as well as some experimental concepts that\nmay become commonplace soon enough.\n\nPopular NFT use cases & ideas\nHere’s a list of 5 popular non-fungible token use cases:\n\nDigital art\nNFTs have been essential in resolving a major issue in the digital art industry:\nscarcity. NFTs help keep your artwork rare even though they can easily be\nreproduced and saved.  And while there's a lot of phony art in the real world,\nwe usually know how to tell them from real art.\n\nMost of the value of NFT art idea comes from digitally validating its legitimacy\nand proprietorship. For example, a Bored Ape art can be copied from the Ethereum\nblockchain, but you cannot prove you possess the original if you don't.\n\nThere’s so much more to NFTs than just the artwork that comes with them. Often,\ndemonstrating ownership of a certain asset is more vital. In part because of\nthis, digital art has become one of the most common use cases for NFTs in recent\nyears.\n\nGaming\nThere is no better pairing than NFTs and gaming. NFTs can be used in video games\nif they can be accessed on several platforms. NFTs also allow game publishers to\ngrow their brand and generate additional revenue streams.\n\nAdditionally, NFTs make in-game trading easy.  Through this NFT idea, the\nblockchain allows for the instantaneous exchange of information between parties.\nThis gives consumers the chance to buy firearms or other equipment that has been\nused and reviewed by other players.\n\nA good example of this NFT use case is the integration of blockchain technology\nby several game publishers. In the spirit of Pokémon Go, both Axie Infinity and \nBattle Pets feature a trading system for both pets and other in-game tokens. And\nif you want to trade these in-game tokens, you can easily do so on secondary\nmarketplaces.\n\nAccess pass and memberships\nNFTs can be used as access passes to exclusive events, merchandise, and\nexperiences that would otherwise be out of reach to the general public. It's\neasy to swap an NFT access card for any other asset on the blockchain since it's\nfluid and unambiguous in its intent.\n\nIf you have a single wallet for all your subscriptions, you'll be able to keep\ntrack of them all. In this NFT use case, memberships may also be utilised to\nflaunt your affiliation with certain clubs and associations. As such, you can\ncapitalise on your personal brand and reputation.\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club is one of the most well-known instances of an NFT that\npermits membership access. As part of the BAYC NFT collection, you become a\nmember of an elite swamp club of apes.\n\nFascinating, right? But that's not all.\n\nYou can also show off your assets on social media if you own a BAYC NFT. Several\nholders use their Bored Ape NFTs as their profile picture on Twitter. This also\ndemonstrates the power of NFTs in promoting your individual brand.\n\nVirtual fashion\nThe NFT market is becoming increasingly crowded with high-end and streetwear\nfashion brands. We’ll also use BAYC as an example of this NFT idea.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club recently partnered with a high-end streetwear brand, The\nHundreds\n[https://www.theboredapegazette.com/post/hundreds-x-bayc-member-exclusive-merch-has-been-shipped-and-bored-apes-are-excited]\n, to produce merchandise for the surrounding community. All the merch sold out\nin a matter of hours. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to\nthe potential use cases of NFTs in the fashion industry.\n\nLuxury brands are also branching into the NFT sector. On September 30, 2020,\nDolce & Gabbana's first nine-piece NFT collection, Collezione Genesi\n[https://blockchain.news/news/dolce--gabbana-bags-6m-fashion-nft-collection-collezione-genesi]\n, went on sale. This collection was a peculiar blend of high fashion and\nblockchain technology that sold for $5.6 million. The collection included both\nreal outfits and their NFT doubles.\n\nWeeks before Collezione Genesi, a new firm named Auroboros revealed a\ncollection\nof digital clothing\n[https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/startup-spotlight-how-digital-fashion-brand-auroboros-is-breaking-through] \nthat you can wear through augmented reality (AR).\n\nAs high fashion and blockchain come together, the fashion industry is in for a\nmassive transformation.  A new set of digital clothing will soon overtake\nindustry aficionados as new technologies like NFTs and AR are combined with\ntraditional couture techniques.\n\nFinance\nThoughts of NFTs typically conjure up images of weird avatars, artworks, or\ncollectible in-game objects. However, as use cases, NFTs have the potential to\noffer distinct financial advantages in the decentralised finance (DeFi) economy.\n\nAn example of an NFT idea is JustLiquidity's NFT staking mode\n[https://justliquidity.medium.com/the-julswap-nft-staking-pools-and-special-staking-pools-2cd5fba3a963]\nl. The model allows you to earn an NFT for accessing the next pool when you\ninvest a pair of tokens in a pool. When you join the next pool, the NFT works as\nan entry ticket and is discarded afterwards. In addition, you can trade this NFT\npass on a secondary market.\n\nMore Top NFT ideas\nBelow is a list of some of the best NFT ideas that could become popular soon:\n\nHealth care\nNFTs have the potential to become a major player in the healthcare sector\n[https://medicalfuturist.com/nfts-an-health-data/].

Now, it’s time to convert your regular photo into an NFT. Wondering how that works? Here’s a step-by-step:</p><h3 id=\"1-create-a-digital-wallet\">1. Create a digital wallet</h3><p>Before buying or selling NFT pictures, you’ll need a digital crypto wallet that holds cryptocurrency (most commonly <strong>Ethereum</strong> or <strong>Bitcoin</strong>). This will allow you to mint an NFT and perform transactions. You wouldn’t visit the mall without some cash or a credit card, right? Same thing, but on the blockchain.</p><p>Some popular digital wallets are <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/\">Coinbase</a> or <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/\">Binance</a> where you just download the app on your phone, create an account, note down your private key (12-word phrase that acts like 2-step verification), and transfer crypto to your wallet via traditional currencies (e.g. USD/Euros).</p><p>Here’s a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/byNNauAJrKI\">video</a> on how to set up a crypto wallet when you’re ready.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byNNauAJrKI&amp;feature=youtu.be</p><h3 id=\"2-set-up-an-account-on-an-nft-marketplace\"><strong>2. Set up an account on an NFT marketplace</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve set up your wallet, now it’s time to create an account on an NFT marketplace, where you’ll be doing business. At its core, it’s really no different than having a Facebook account to buy or sell items on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>You’ll be prompted to link your new digital wallet to your NFT marketplace account. Do note that you’ll need to verify your identity with many of the platforms. Here’s a shortlist of the most popular NFT marketplaces for NFT photographers:</p><ul><li>OpenSea</li><li>Rarible</li><li>SuperRare</li><li>Foundation</li><li>Nifty Gateway</li><li>Mintable</li></ul><p>Aside from marketplaces, you can also explore <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/nft-gallery/\">NFT galleries and platforms</a> to show off your projects to increase visibility and branding, as well as boost your NFT’s value.</p><h3 id=\"3-upload-your-digital-image\">3. Upload your digital image</h3><p>Really simple step: just upload your digital asset (aka photograph) – the accepted formats are most commonly JPG, PNG, and MP4.</p><h3 id=\"4-mint-the-nft\">4. Mint the NFT</h3><p>Minting your photograph into a non-fungible token means assigning a tamper-proof identifier (like a digital serial number) to your photo on the (again, most commonly Ethereum) blockchain.</p><p>You’ll need to add a title and description, which can never be edited once the minting is complete – so make sure you have no typos and that you’re satisfied with the content!</p><p>Keep in mind that minting your <strong>NFT pictures may incur gas fees which are also paid in cryptocurrency like Ethereum</strong>.</p><p><strong>What are gas fees?</strong></p><p>They’re charges for blockchain users to compensate for the computational power required to process and validate transactions. For reference, the <a href=\"https://zipmex.com/learn/what-are-gas-fees/#:~:text=Gas%20Fee%20in%20OpenSea&amp;text=The%20first%20fee%20is%20used,can%20be%20higher%20or%20lower.\">gas fees on OpenSea can range from 10 to 300 USD</a> depending on the nature of the transaction.</p><h3 id=\"5-how-to-price-your-nft-photography\">5.

Here’s a shortlist of the most popular NFT marketplaces for NFT\nphotographers:\n\n * OpenSea\n * Rarible\n * SuperRare\n * Foundation\n * Nifty Gateway\n * Mintable\n\nAside from marketplaces, you can also explore NFT galleries and platforms\n[https://blog.milliondollartokenpage.com/nft-gallery/] to show off your projects\nto increase visibility and branding, as well as boost your NFT’s value.\n\n3. Upload your digital image\nReally simple step: just upload your digital asset (aka photograph) – the\naccepted formats are most commonly JPG, PNG, and MP4.\n\n4. Mint the NFT\nMinting your photograph into a non-fungible token means assigning a tamper-proof\nidentifier (like a digital serial number) to your photo on the (again, most\ncommonly Ethereum) blockchain.\n\nYou’ll need to add a title and description, which can never be edited once the\nminting is complete – so make sure you have no typos and that you’re satisfied\nwith the content!\n\nKeep in mind that minting your NFT pictures may incur gas fees which are also\npaid in cryptocurrency like Ethereum.\n\nWhat are gas fees?\n\nThey’re charges for blockchain users to compensate for the computational power\nrequired to process and validate transactions. For reference, the gas fees on\nOpenSea can range from 10 to 300 USD\n[https://zipmex.com/learn/what-are-gas-fees/#:~:text=Gas%20Fee%20in%20OpenSea&text=The%20first%20fee%20is%20used,can%20be%20higher%20or%20lower.] \ndepending on the nature of the transaction.\n\n5. How to price your NFT photography\nIt’s admittedly difficult to price your NFT pictures the right way. The last\nthing you want is to be the artist who spent hundreds of dollars minting your\nNFT artwork, only to be stuck with it. But what is the ideal price?\n\nThe truth is that there’s no cut-out formula for every photographer. But there’s\na handful of considerations and practices you can do when approaching a price\nfor your NFT photo.\n\nFirst, ask yourself the following:\n\n * Am I an emerging or established artist? Generally, if you’re new to the NFT\n   photography space, you don’t have much street cred yet, so don’t charge an\n   absurd amount for your photos. Focus on building your audience and community\n   (covered in a following section), and once you’ve gained some popularity,\n   it’ll be much easier to sell your photos and justify a higher price.\n * How rare is my art/photograph? As mentioned before, the available quantity of\n   your NFT photos can impact its valuation. Is your artwork truly\n   one-of-a-kind? Are you selling multiple editions? 10? 100? As a rule of\n   thumb, if there are multiple editions, it will be classified more as a\n   collectible than a unique work of art. Experiment with what sells best. For\n   some artists, high-priced, rare artworks sell faster than multiple-edition,\n   cheaper ones, and for others, it's the opposite.\n\nOnce you’ve fleshed out the answers to the above questions, feel free to follow\nthese pro tips that other successful NFT photographers employ:\n\n * Raise your prices consistently. While many believe it’s easy to be successful\n   and sell NFT pictures for a high price because that’s all they see on the\n   news, again, as a beginner you want to start small and gradually increase\n   your floor price with experience.\n * Provide elements of value (to justify higher prices). In the long run,\n   collectors may appreciate more than just aesthetics and favor the utility\n   (unique features) of your NFT photo. As a little extra surprise, you could\n   include cool unlockables, such as exclusive access to your next drop, a\n   discount on your next piece, or a physical print of your NFT picture.\n   Brainstorm fun ways to make the collector's experience worthwhile and to\n   thank them for their trust.\n * Categorize your photography for different customer segments. Several\n   marketplaces exist with various customers in the NFT space. Depending on the\n   types of customers you want to target, you can segment your artwork into two\n   or three different categories. You can offer lower-priced work for buyers who\n   are looking for cheaper NFTs, medium-priced multiple editions, and\n   high-priced, rare pieces for high-profile collectors.\n * Experiment with different blockchain platforms. Open Ethereum marketplaces\n   like OpenSea and Rarible can be a great place to begin while you wait for\n   acceptance on more exclusive marketplaces. It may make sense to sell\n   collectibles that are lower priced on non-Ethereum-based platforms, and\n   higher-priced NFTs on more exclusive NFT marketplaces. That said, you want to\n   remain consistent and honest with prices as an artist, so don’t try selling\n   the same NFT pictures for 0.1 ETH on one platform, and for 1 ETH on another.\n\nIf you don't sell anything in the first month or even two months, don't beat\nyourself up. With so many artists competing for attention, it can be difficult\nto get noticed, especially when you're new to the scene. It's okay if your first\nfew works sell for less than you expected. Prices can always be raised later.\nDon't be discouraged or regret it. Stay patient and continue to capture your\nfavorite moments.\n\n6. List the NFT & make sales\nBam. Once you’re done with the creation and planning, it’s time to put your NFT\nphoto up for auction or sale. Of course, listing the NFT picture incurs another\ngas fee, but photographers can’t make a sale without it. After your non-fungible\ntoken has been listed, buyers can place bids – as the vendor, you can set this\nas an open-ended process, or a time-limited auction.\n\nWhen you get a bid and accept it, you’ll receive the agreed amount of\ncryptocurrency while your NFT photo is transferred to the buyer.\n\nUnique shots > stock photos\nAlthough there aren’t any laws or regulations prohibiting users from selling\nuploaded stock imagery (that was of course purchased through regular currency),\nit’s important to remember that beyond the written rules, your NFT pictures are\nvalued for their uniqueness and scarcity.\n\nIf someone can just go and purchase rights to your stock photo on Shutterstock\nfor $30, why would they bother paying for it on the blockchain with Ethereum\nalong with gas fees? You’re also risking your personal brand and integrity as a\nphotographer, which isn’t good for business.\n\nPromote your work & engage your community\nWhen promoting and advertising your NFT\n[https://blog.milliondollartokenpage.com/market-promote-advertise-your-nft/],\nthe community is the most important to keep in mind. A loyal and active\ncommunity can appreciate and critique your captures, grow your popularity,\nencourage word of mouth, and help you price your NFT photos accordingly.\n\nWithout a community, you have no supporters. You’re a sitting duck. So how do\nyou start building one out?\n\n * Instagram – if you’re a photographer, then you know that Instagram is a major\n   hub for sharing beautiful photography, and it’s probably where most of our\n   audiences live – making it a great marketing channel. Just be sure to ease\n   your followers into it, as many may not be familiar with NFT photography, or\n   they may hold some skepticism or judgment toward the space.\n\n * If you’re active on other visual spaces like Pinterest, it could be another\n   channel for you to redirect your audience to an NFT marketplace where they\n   can check out your exclusive pieces for sale.\n * Forums (e.g. Reddit & Clubhouse) – a great avenue for open-ended and\n   free-flowing discussions about NFT photography, its niches, and nuances. By\n   sharing your inputs, you make yourself known amongst others, paving an\n   organic pathway to your own NFT photography.\n * Discord communities – NFT photographers have the opportunity to nurture their\n   communities in a truly personalized setting with so many server customization\n   features. Most NFT communities have their own dedicated server, you can\n   create your own and be a part of multiple photography group chats to engage\n   outsiders to turn them into insiders.\n * Twitter – here’s where all the action happens first in the NFT space. You\n   want to have a solid Twitter presence as it can boost your credibility, which\n   as mentioned earlier, can help justify higher NFT picture prices. Reply to\n   tweets, join space sessions, and share your NFT updates here.\n\nFeel free to check out our more in-depth guide on how to build and engage an\nNFT\ncommunity\n[https://blog.milliondollartokenpage.com/build-and-engage-nft-community/].\n\nShow off your killer NFT photography on The Million Dollar Token Page.\nIf you want a clear stage and spotlight for your special NFT photography, you\ncan get some great publicity by buying a block of pixels on \nmilliondollartokenpage.com [https://milliondollartokenpage.com/about].\n\nLike a big-ticket billboard, your NFT picture(s) can be on wide display on a\ndedicated web page.

We released the first version of MDTP in September 2021\nand A LOT has happened since then. \n\nHaving worked as devs on big projects like Sprite Club, Creepz and Mint\nCalendar, we've learned a lot and have begun to incorporate these learnings into\nMDTP and will continue to do so with everything we do moving forward 🏎!\n\nAs a business, we have a bunch of things on the roadmap and we are keen to share\nthem all with you. We've recently incorporated our company and in the next week\nwe're launching a brand new idea called Frames, so keep your eyes peeled (or \njump in our discord [http://discord.gg/bUeQjW4KSN]!) to learn more 👀.\n\nToday, the focus is on our updated contract.\n\nOptimising our contract\nThe biggest update to MDTP is that it's now super gas efficient. When we started\nwith v1 we hadn't really thought too much about gas - the NFT market was roaring\naway and people were minting projects without too much concern about how much it\ncost. Since then, lots of projects have realised that optimising gas can play a\nsignificant part in the cost of a project. We've learnt a lot and we even\ncreated our own standard ERC-721S for Sprite Club (named after Azuki's ERC-721A)\nwhich is incredibly gas efficient. \n\nWe've brought all these learnings over to MDTP and we can see the benefits here:\n\nThis is measured with a gas price of 50 gwei and eth at $3452. So minting a\nsingle token (mintToken above) goes from ~$25 to ~$18 which is a saving of ~25%!\nMinting a group of 9 tokens (mintTokenGroup above) goes from costing ~$150 to\n$48 only, saving almost 66%!! Doesn't that sound good 💪💪\n\nWe know many (most?) of our community members are product builders themselves so\nwe've got a blog post coming up going as deep as we can into understanding gas\ncosts, how to balance that with product and how we actually save gas costs\nwherever possible. Join our discord [http://discord.gg/bUeQjW4KSN] to get a\nfirst peak at that!\n\nWe've also added a bunch of (now) common sense things we didnt know to add to\nthe first contract. Pausability and a bit more flexibility in minting and\ntransferring are the biggest additions here. Go read the new contract\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x8e720f90014fa4de02627f4a4e217b7e3942d5e8#code] \nand come ask us any questions you have 📜\n\nSaying no to upgrade-ability\nWhen we started planning for the new MDTP contract we immediately realised this\nmay be needed again. It's tough in the smart contract game because you can't fix\nmistakes, especially coming from a world where I was deploying to production\nmany, many times everyday! \n\nSo we seriously considered looking into upgradable contracts. They are used by\nsome very big projects like Uniswap v3 Router\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45#code] \nand 0x Exchange Protocol\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xdef1c0ded9bec7f1a1670819833240f027b25eff#code],\nwhich both use upgradable contracts (two of the most used smart contracts on\nEthereum). If you don't know much about upgradable contracts, here's a great\nprimer by Moralis\n[https://moralis.io/what-are-upgradable-smart-contracts-full-guide/]. In\nessence, it allows the storage and logic of the smart contract to be decoupled\nso that the logic can be updated in the future.\n\nBut this comes at a big cost. It means the developers can update the logic at\nany moment so means that as minters you would have to trust us to not do\nanything bad. For example, a bad dev could update the contract such that the \nownerOf function just returns their own address for all tokens 😱.\n\nWhilst we would love for all our users to have the utmost faith in us, we don't\nlike the idea of going against things we believe in. We love that smart\ncontracts allow a decentralised, trust-less operation across millions of\naccounts and we're keen to uphold that. We had originally implemented MDTP v2 as\nupgradable but are proud to say we've now stripped that out entirely.\n\nWe may use upgradable contracts in the future but they will only be in cases\nwhere a non-upgradable contract points to a purely logical upgradable contract\nthat cannot have an impact on users, purely on internal mechanics. If you're\ncurious about this, jump into our discord we'd love to dive deeper!\n\nMigration\nSo, we now have two live contracts on the Ethereum mainnet. The old v1 and the\nbrand new v2. So there's a few things we need to update as a team and as a\ncommunity going forward. \n\nHere are the three main parts to our migration:\n\nMDTP dapp\nThe first is the dapp thats running at MillionDollarTokenPage.com\n[https://MillionDollarTokenPage.com]. By the time you are reading this that\nwould have already happened. It's as simple as pointing the page to the new\ncontract and making sure it's using the new function names we've given. We've\nadded a few cool markers to show our love for people that minted before v2, go\nfind them!\n\nCurrent tokens\nSince both contracts will exist at the same time, there will actually be 20k\nMDTP tokens in the world right now - 10k from the old contract and 10k from the\nnew one. But we only have 10k spaces on the dapp. So the dapp only looks at the\nnew contract to set its content.\n\nHowever, we need to make sure the owners of the old tokens still have access to\ntheir space on the new version. We definitely can't sell the new token that's\ncreated representing that space. So we've created a proxy in the new contract\nwhich points to the old one for specific tokens. So any tokens bought in v1 will\nstill have the same content and be managed by their owners. New tokens will be\nbought and updated purely through the new contract.\n\nIf someone was to mint old v1 tokens today, they wouldn't really be able to do\nanything with them since the new contract won't proxy for them. \n\nAnother key factor here is marketplaces - someone going to OpenSea or LooksRare\nwould see an MDTP token from the old collection looking the same as one from the\nnew collection. To combat this we are updating the metadata on the old contract\nso any tokens that were not minted before our snapshot will be rendered invalid.\nThe metadata will have something really obvious on the marketplaces so people\nknow they aren't valid anymore.\n\nCurrent owners\nThe next challenge is for the owners of v1 to become owners of their\ncorresponding v2 tokens. We want to make sure this is done in a safe and secure\nway; we call it Token Migration.\n\nThe process will be for v1 holders to transfer their token into the v2 contract.\nThe v2 contract will only accept the transfers for tokens minted before v2\nstarted, so no cheating!\n\nThere's no rush for current holders to migrate - they will get the benefits of\nframes immediately. They'll definitely want to migrate in the future tho when we\nget our next big project going *ahem*METABUCKS*ahem*.\n\nFor individual tokens you can click the migrate button on the page. For token\ngroups it requires etherscan for now and if you're keen to do it now we'd be\nglad to take you through it, just send a message to us in the Discord\n[http://discord.gg/bUeQjW4KSN]and we will help!\n\nAlso, anyone that minted v1 tokens will get special traits on their tokens and\nframes that will never go away. We'll add more utility to the OG trait over time\nso you know we love you :)\n\nThat was a lot, anything else?\nNow that we have v2 launched we're committed to building in public. In that vein\nhere are the things we will be announcing over the next few weeks\n\n * Frames + PFPKit (announcement this week, launching in 2 weeks)\n * Company rebrand to TokenPage (~3 weeks)\n * Discord re-structure (~4 weeks)\n * SpriteClub TokenPage UI (~4 weeks)\n\nThese dates are purely speculative but if as we work through these projects in\npublic you'll know if there are delays happening on our discord.\n\nWe have a bunch more ideas we haven't discussed publicly yet but follow us on\ntwitter and jump in our discord to be the first to hear about them. All we can\nsay for now is that everything we build going forward will generate value for\nMDTP NFT holders in some way, so now is always the best time to grab some :) \n\nAs usual, follow us on Twitter [https://twitter.com/mdtp_app] and jump in our\nDiscord [https://discord.gg/bUeQjW4KSN] (it's not like any others) to stay up to\ndate and get in touch with us!","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/promo-banner-4.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-03-31 14:16:41","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-06 16:07:08","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2022-04-06 15:31:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"6258718ea6a34100014fc47c","uuid":"0bc94920-c147-4d3d-87a7-7e6e44c513ad","title":"Represent your community in style with Frames 🖼","slug":"frames","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/pfpkit-output-merged.png\",\"width\":2654,\"height\":1326,\"cardWidth\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-27-at-15.07.06.png\",\"width\":420,\"height\":686,\"cardWidth\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/framed-nfts-2.png\",\"width\":2198,\"height\":2198}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<video controls width=\\\"100%\\\">\\n    <source src=\\\"https://mdtp-images.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pfpkkit-example.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\" />\\n</video>\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-27-at-16.19.34.png\",\"width\":296,\"height\":274}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://mdtp-images.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/frame.gif\",\"alt\":\"frames\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://milliondollartokenpage.com\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/krishan711\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://discord.com/users/krishan#0711\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.outkast.world/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://linkedin.com/in/krishan711\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://pfpkit.xyz\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://discord.gg/5VHd9tzX\"]],[\"code\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicij5pjwvwueqqnr7m5krlt3rnb5ldysiwl7ubhcg7i4bq6syqanu/0.json\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://mintcalendar.com\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://pfpkit.xyz/frames\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/mdtp_app\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://discord.gg/bUeQjW4KSN\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[1,[],0,0],[0,[],0,\"DAOs, alpha-groups, token-gated communities and any other non-PFP NFTs, isn't it time you were represented on you community members' profiles?

We think so too.\nwe're so excited to show you a new way to get your members feeling proud 👇\n\nAs you know, most of the NFT market these days is fuelled by PFP projects. These\nprojects have the amazing power that people actually use the token they buy to\nrepresent themselves on twitter / discord / wherever by changing their PFP. \n\nIt's a level of engagement ex-web2 people like me can only dream of 🔥\n\nBut it means a whole bunch of projects like DAOs, token-gated communities, tool\nmemberships and non-PFP projects (like MDTP) don't get to benefit from this\namazing community hype-spreading. So we're fixing that with our new product, we\ncall it:\n\n✨ FRAMES ✨\n(or Profile Frames, or PFFs 😛) \n\nHere's an example of what we're talking about:\n\nThese are my new profile pictures with my awesome MDTP\n[https://milliondollartokenpage.com] frame. \n\nYou can see it on Twitter [https://twitter.com/krishan711] and on Discord\n[https://discord.com/users/krishan#0711]. Looks great doesn't it? I love it\nbecause within the profile picture I'm able to use an NFT I love (shoutout to \nOutkast NFT [https://www.outkast.world/]) and I can show my allegiance to MDTP\nwith my frame. You can even see my profile on LinkedIn\n[https://linkedin.com/in/krishan711] where I dare not set an NFT PFP but can\nstill use the frame 🙌.\n\nFrames give NFT communities an easy way for members to show their allegiances\nwherever they can have a profile picture!\n\nOur Problem at MDTP\nWhen we launched MillionDollarTokenPage [https://milliondollartokenpage.com] \nback in September, we quickly discovered a problem. Let me paint a picture.\n\nWe truly believe NFTs are the future of ownership. So we built a site where you\nbuy a block of space and can edit it to show off your favorite thing in the\nworld to everyone that visits our site (up to thousands of people a day!). When\nyou buy a block, you get an NFT and that's what controls your permissions to\nedit the block. \n\nBut our NFT itself doesn't have any artistic value - we want our owners to be\ncreative themselves. This made it harder to sell in a world where everyone came\nto the discord saying \"wen reveal\" and \"what do you mean i can set content on\nthe site\".\n\nOur NFTs currently look like this on OpenSea:\n\nWe realized that we don't have the key advantages of PFP NFT projects - \nrepresentation on a timeline. Let's be honest, even I haven't thought for a\nsecond about using the MDTP black grid as my profile picture.\n\nWhen people see a certain type of ape/penguin/sprite/etc all over their twitter\nand discord, it signals to them that this project is something people are\nwilling to represent themselves with. \n\nBut, we're sure some of our community would love to rep MDTP. It's a cool place\nwhere we have fun, technical discussions and even help bring teams together.\n\nA colorful new world\nIn the next couple of days everyone's MDTP tokens (v1 and v2) are going to be\nupdated to include frames.

For all intents and purposes, we will assume you are selling your NFT on <strong>OpenSea</strong> and <strong>minting into the Ethereum blockchain</strong> because these are the most popular mediums to date. However, we will discuss alternatives later in this article. <br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6VrWmxAtNK6dicN4ZCxSsJk0jaYfVoQONUyY8BX9F5unErX7r8SKjXrD2jPYGIAamX5C_S3AU9buDIx-OxgXzXtKnb67gELZq9Xu5kJfW_E2NNUevA319FV9Xt1q1MliJxKwRhgiUmrU5XfVrA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br></p><p>Generally, you can expect to pay between $1 and $500 to mint your NFT depending on the various factors that we will discuss later in this article. <br></p><h2 id=\"calculating-the-cost-to-mint-an-nft\">Calculating the Cost to Mint an NFT</h2><p>The following formula can calculate the total cost of minting an NFT:<br></p><p><strong>Total cost to mint = account initialization fees + gas fees + listing fees.</strong><br></p><p>While the upfront minting cost can be reduced by deferring to lazy minting and opting for marketplaces and blockchains with small initialization and listing fees, the total price paid to sell your NFT ends up being about the same. <br></p><p><strong>Total cost to sell = Nft cost - gas fees - account initialization fees - listing fee - selling fee. </strong><br></p><h3 id=\"gas-fees\">Gas Fees</h3><p>Gas fees are costs that you will encounter in any Ethereum transaction. \"Gas\" refers to fees that are paid to miners during every blockchain transaction. These fees will fluctuate heavily based on the type of transaction and the number of people transacting at that time. While \"gas\" is specific to the Ethereum network, other blockchains have a comparable computational fee. <br></p><p>While the gas costs are somewhat complex, we will break them down in layman's terms. Gas fees are denoted as GWEI, one of which equates to one-millionth of Etherium. So the USD conversion is also contingent on the current ETH value. Each transaction has a gas limit, base fee, and tip, so these are the main factors to consider when estimating gas fees. <br></p><h3 id=\"gas-limit\">Gas Limit:</h3><p>The gas limit is the amount you are willing to pay on a given transaction. For example, 21,000 GWEI is the recommended gas limit, as this will cover most transactions.<br></p><h4 id=\"base-fee\"><strong>Base Fee:</strong></h4><p>The base fee is the minimum fee or reserve price associated with your transaction.<br></p><h4 id=\"tip\"><strong>Tip:</strong></h4><p>Users are expected to set a tip that will be paid to the miner and prioritize their transaction. Most wallets will automatically set this for you. <br></p><h4 id=\"calculation\"><strong>Calculation:</strong></h4><p>The calculation for the total transaction fee is as follows: Gas limit * (Base fee + tip). Let's say you set the gas limit at the recommended 21,000 GWEI, the base fee is 100 GWEI, and you set a tip of 10 GWEI. The total gas fees would look like: 21,000 * (100 + 10) = 2,310,000 GWEI or .00231 ETH. <br></p><h2 id=\"how-to-avoid-gas-fees-when-minting\">How to Avoid Gas Fees When Minting:</h2><p>If you're feeling discouraged, fear not! What if we told you there was a way to bypass gas fees when minting your NFT? Well, there is. <strong>Lazy minting</strong> is a way to avoid paying gas fees upfront by simply uploading the file without converting it to an NFT. <br></p><p>When someone buys your art, the buyer will cover the gas fees at the time of purchase, at which time your art will be converted to an NFT.<br></p><p>This eliminates the risk of paying gas fees to mint an NFT that nobody ends up buying. But keep in mind that when lazy minting, the gas fees are baked into the cost of the NFT, so while a buyer may pay $1000 for your NFT, your creator profit will come down to $1000 - gas fees - 2.5% listing fee - initial account fee. So your net profit will end up being the same, the difference being that with lazy minting, you don't pay until someone buys. <br></p><h3 id=\"account-fees\"><strong>Account Fees:</strong></h3><p>While lazy minting sounds like a great way to bypass gas fees, many marketplaces have account fees that you must pay to set up your account and start selling. For OpenSea, this cost is generally around $50 to $70. However, other marketplaces, such as Rarible, have initiation fees as low as $15. You can also pay smaller account fees when choosing to mint through other blockchains such as Flow or Polygon, but because these currencies have a much smaller adoption than Ethereum, you may have a more challenging time selling your NFT. <br></p><h3 id=\"listing-and-service-fees\"><strong>Listing and Service Fees</strong></h3><p>Some platforms are free to mint on; others charge a listing fee. Most marketplaces will also charge a service fee (usually 2.5%) when the artwork is purchased, which comes directly out of your take-home profit. <br></p><h2 id=\"choosing-a-blockchain\">Choosing a BlockChain</h2><p>Because Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for NFTs to date, it is the most expensive one to mint. However, because it is the most widely-adopted currency for NFT exchanges, you may have an easier time finding buyers for your NFT when it is minted on the ETH blockchain.<br></p><p>Because Ethereum is the most widely used blockchain, this is where you will find all of your well-known NFTs such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Crypto Punks<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_j5gx4TiGThZ3C2R11zsUxwhePtRJswwXIiZdEMyoZRCU8p82Q4WNUiTNPvfgdzTqwaSUo97aNjyqpWLwHksLDHlP2UNX_DkJs78yoRrpnwRcDHmx7pvRp9JC8x7VeEM35H5ziOVZy1_Xr_xzw\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>A popular NFT, CryptoPunks, <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/8070\">Sourced from OpenSea</a><br></p><p>If you want to opt for a more affordable option, <strong>Solona</strong> and <strong>Polygon</strong> are other networks that are growing in popularity.

Be sure to reach out to the NFT project’s Discord community to inquire about promotional opportunities.</p><h4 id=\"example-of-leveraging-social-media-to-get-nfts\"><strong>Example of leveraging social media to get NFTs</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/farokh\"><strong>Farokh</strong></a> is a top NFT influencer on Twitter.

Be sure to try at least a couple of these strategies. Before you know it, you can have a rather sizable NFT collection without spending a dime. If you would like to know more about free NFTs and NFTs in general, be sure to check the latest posts from <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/\">The Million Dollar Token Homepage. </a><br><br><br></p>","comment_id":"62a9d2da0f177e0001129907","plaintext":"You have probably heard of people who have turned $200 into over $1 million by\nsimply buying and flipping NFTs. Well, those days are pretty much over. Today,\nyou will need to spend a little more if you want to become the next NFT\nmillionaire. However, if you don’t have any money or if you don’t want to buy\nNFTs, there is a way to get started with your collection for free.\n\n\nAt Million Dollar Token Homepage [__GHOST_URL__/], we\nhave discovered several ways that you can get free NFTs. This is an excellent\nway for you to start your collection without having to invest any of your\nhard-earned money. \n\n\nBear in mind that you are unlikely to find the next Bored Ape through these free\nmethods. However, you can easily build up a respectable collection that will\nhave some value. Who knows? After spending a year or so gathering free NFTs, you\nmay be able to flip them for a decent amount of money. \n\n\n\n1). Earn-to-Play Games\nPerhaps one of the easiest ways to get free NFTs is through play-to-earn games.\nToday, many gamers are looking at play-to-earn as a great way to make a little\nside income. In these games, you can end up earning in-game tokens which can\nthen be transferred to other cryptocurrencies. However, you can also earn NFTs\nwhich can be flipped on the secondary market. \n\nThe good news is that there is a growing list of games that allow you to earn\nfree NFTs. Some of the top games that have a play-to-earn NFT reward system\ninclude Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and The Sandbox. There are also hundreds of\nother smaller games that have play-to-earn NFT opportunities.\n\nGetting started to play-to-earn games\nTo get started with play-to-earn games, you will need to have a crypto wallet\nand you will have to register your account. Some games will offer you a free NFT\nfor simply signing up for the game. \n\nAfter you have signed up for the game it is time to earn your NFTs. Usually, you\nwill be able to earn free NFTs by completing missions, winning battles, or\ngaining an achievement. The NFTs offered could include everything, from in-game\nweapons to skins or other items that are used in the game. \n\nThis means that the NFTs that you can get for free will only have value for\nthose who play the game. Therefore, it is a good idea to get started with big\ngames such as Axie Infinity. This will give you a much better chance to gain\nsomething of value when selling the NFT on the secondary market. \n\n2). NFT Airdrops\nOne of the best ways to get valuable NFTs for free is through an NFT airdrop.\nThis free method of gaining an NFT may require you to purchase an initial NFT.\nTherefore, if you have a little bit of money to invest, then you will want to\nconsider purchasing an NFT that is likely to have NFT airdrops in the future.\n\nThe best way to find out if an NFT is going to have an NFT airdrop is to check\nthe roadmap. A roadmap is a document that NFT creators publish which informs\ncollectors as to how the project will proceed over the next 12 to 24 months.\nSeveral NFT projects will propose an NFT airdrop to entice people to purchase an\ninitial NFT. \n\nHow to find NFT airdrops\nSeveral websites offer updates and news about airdrops. One of the best places\nto get started is AirDropAlerts.com. The website also has an active Twitter feed\nwhich can keep you up-to-date on future airdrops.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out the Million Dollar Token Homepage\n[https://blog.milliondollartokenpage.com/]. The site will be updated with the\nlatest news on NFT and token airdrops for projects big and small. \n\n3). Free NFT Mints\nDid you know that you can get NFTs straight from the project creators at no\ncost? Today, several NFT projects are desperate to get attention. Given the fact\nthat thousands of NFT projects are launched each week, it is hard to get people\nto notice every project. However, there is one publicity tactic that never seems\nto happen daily - free NFT minting. \n\nAll you have to do is keep your eye out on projects that will offer free NFTs\nduring the mint. There is usually a very limited window of opportunity here\nsince the free supply of NFTs will go fast. Therefore, you will want to know\nwhere to look.\n\nHow to find NFTs to mint for free\nThere are a couple of ways that you can find NFTs that you can mind for free.\nFirst, you can simply do a Google search for “Free NFT mints.” There, you will\nfind NFT project homepages that will be announcing free-to-mint NFTs. Also, you\nwill want to conduct a Twitter search for the team, “Free NFT mints.” Twitter is\nthe social media site where NFT projects are most active to the public. You will\nhave no problem finding free NFT minting opportunities.\n\nIf you try to mint one NFT for free each day, then you can end up with hundreds\nof free NFTs after one year. Chances are that you will have at least a couple of\nNFTs that can be worth something. \n\nExample of a free NFT mint\nOne project that is offering free NFTs is Cryptosaurs\n[https://cryptosaurs.one/free-to-mint-nfts/]. The NFTs themselves are completely\nfree. All you have to pay for are any associated blockchain fees. \n\n4). Make Your Own NFT\nPerhaps one of the easiest ways to get free NFTs into your wallet is to simply\ncreate your own. Some people are under the assumption that you have to pay huge\ngas fees to mint your NFT. The truth is that there are now ways that you can\ncreate your NFT for free. \n\nHere is a walk through on how you can create your NFT at no cost: \n\nHow to Mint NFT for Free on Opensea without any gas fee | Post NFT for Free |\nNo\nGas Fee [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_RJXA92G8s]:\n\n * Connect an ETH wallet onto an OpenSea account.\n * After you have connected your wallet, create a collection on the OpenSea\n   account. You can create the collection on your OpenSea dashboard.\n * Customize what your collection will look like to the public by adding a logo\n   and a banner as well as any relevant information.\n * Here is the important part. You will need to pick a blockchain to mint your\n   NFT. As you know the Ethereum blockchain has high gas fees. However, you can\n   create your NFT for free by using the Polygon blockchain.\n * Finally, you can start minting your collection on OpenSea. Once you have\n   minted your NFT, you can sell it in the marketplace. Note that you will have\n   to set a minimum price of $2.\n\nThe fact is that creating your own NFT will not make them valuable. If you want\nto create value for the free NFTs that you created, then you will need to\npromote them. The best way to promote your NFTs for free is by using Twitter. \n\nSince the social media platform has so many NFT projects, you will need to be\ncreative as to how you promote your NFT collection. \n\nA great way to promote your NFT collection is to specifically target an interest\ngroup that would appeal to your NFT. For instance, if you create an NFT\ncollection of illustrated cats, then you will want to target cat lovers on\nTwitter. \n\n\n\n\n5). Twitter NFT Giveaway Promotions\nAs stated before, Twitter is pretty much the most popular platform for NFT\nproject creators to promote their collections. One of the most effective\npromotional ideas is to offer an NFT giveaway. During these giveaways, you have\na chance to win an NFT that will likely have some value to it. However, you will\nhave to do a little work to be considered for the giveaway. \n\n\nHow to participate in an NFT giveaway\nConduct a Twitter search for the team “NFT giveaway.” At any given time, there\nshould be hundreds of NFT giveaways going on at the same time. When you find an\nNFT giveaway that you like, be sure to follow the instructions to qualify. The\nNFT project creators will usually require you to do one or more of the following\nactions:\n\n\n * Follow the project on Twitter\n * Re-tweet\n * Ask people to follow the NFT account\n * Join the NFT project’s Discord community \n   \n\nYour chances of winning an NFT giveaway are small. Therefore, you may want to\nenter dozens of NFT giveaways to increase your chances.\n\nExample of NFT giveaway promotion\nYou can find the latest NFT giveaways on the Facebook page NFT - Free\nPromotions\n& GIveaways [https://www.facebook.com/groups/414615440383148/]. Every day there\nare over a dozen free NFT promotions available. \n\n\n6). Leverage Social Media To Sponsor NFTs\nFinally, if you have a large social media following, then you can leverage your\nbrand to get free NFTs. All you have to do is contact the NFT project team and\noffer to promote the project in return for free NFTs. \n\n\nBe aware that you need to have a large enough following to justify someone\ngiving you free NFTs. If your social media accounts are not focused on NFTs,\nthen you will need a large audience of at least 10,000 followers on Twitter,\nInstagram, or Youtube. However, if you have an NFT-focused account, then you may\nbe able to get promo opportunities with as few as 2,000 followers on any of\nthese platforms. Be sure to reach out to the NFT project’s Discord community to\ninquire about promotional opportunities.\n\nExample of leveraging social media to get NFTs\nFarokh [https://twitter.com/farokh] is a top NFT influencer on Twitter. With\nover 236,000 followers, Forokh is always approached by NFT projects and receives\nNFTs as part of his compensation. \n\n\n\nGetting Free NFTs In Your Collection\nAs you can see, there are several ways that you can add free NFTs to your\ncollection.
